Integration Testing:
--------------------
     Integration testing in .NET, as in any software development context, refers to testing 
the interaction between different modules or components of a software system. In the context of .NET development,
integration testing involves testing how various parts of a .NET application work together as a whole.

Here are some key aspects of integration,

1.Testing integration between Components: 
-----------------------------------------
   .net app compose multiple components such as classes,modules,databases and services.Integration testing verifies
that components work together correctly when combined.

2.Testing API and service Integration:
--------------------------------------
     Many .NET applications interact with external APIs or services. Integration testing ensures that
these integrations function as expected, including verifying data exchange, error handling, and communication protocols.

3.Database Integration Testing:
-------------------------------
    In .NET applications, databases are commonly used for storing and retrieving data. Integration testing may involve verifying
that data is correctly persisted and retrieved from the database, as well as testing interactions with database transactions and queries.

Unit Testing:
------------
  Unit Testing is a software technique.In this individual units or components of a software applications are tested to ensure that they
work coorectly.A unit typically refers to the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class.
